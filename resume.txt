AMOILS.COM

After maintaining their previous store front in Volusion & implementing many
iterative redesigns of their website, I had the opportunity to perform a
complete redesign & recode of their website. With the new version of the site,
we decided to bring the design to a more modern, clean look that was responsive
across all major screen sizes. We used Bootstrap v3 to provide a solid
foundation for the responsive work, & then implemented the new theme in
Magento, along with many custom developed modules.

MEXINSURANCE.COM

After several years of mainaining a previous version of their website, we were
given the opportunity to redesign & recode their website. We went with a more
modern, responsive design, & chose FuelPHP as the framework of choice for the
development. Since the rebuild of their websites, sales have steadily &
consistently risen for the last 2 years.

We've had the opportunity to work with Cole Hamels (pitcher for the

functionality throughout the website.
